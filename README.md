# Goliath
6 dof robot arm CORE code for the ARM

Becouse the Teensy4.1 gives higer resultion I tried using the timer interupt to sychronize all motors including acceleration and deacceration.

How to use :

downloard the ZIP file by clicking view raw , in arduino/libraries folder extract or just upload the zip in the arduino IDE

This can be implemented with the IK solver but in general in the Firware sketch
